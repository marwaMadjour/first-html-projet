<h1> Virtualization </h1>
 <p>In computing, <b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual<I> (rather than actual) </I> version of something,</p>
<p>This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
<hr>
<h1> Levels of Virtualization</h1>
<ol>
<Li> <label><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</b></label></Li>
<p>Every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>
<li><b>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</b></li>
<p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
<ul> 
<li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>

<li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.</li>
 </ul>
